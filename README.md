# rl-mech-interp
Repo for my master's thesis focusing on RL.

Currently most of the work is being done at https://github.com/BenSturgeon/ai-safety-camp-2024-model-agents/tree/main/, but I am keeping the writing here.

When most of the work is done there I will clean up and move most of the essential code to this repo. This repo will contain only the work that I was primarily responsible for.
